Package: salvaged
Architecture: any
Depends: ${shlibs:Depends}, ${misc:Depends}
Description: Salvage Coin (SVG) is an open-source Proof-of-Stake
 digital crypto currency for fast (using SwiftX), private (Zerocoin
 protocol) and secure microtransactions. Our main goal is to create
 a decentralized fully secure and anonymous network to run
 applications which do not rely on any central body control. By
 having a distributed system, thousands of users will be responsible
 for maintaining the application and data so that there is no single
 point of failure.
 .
 Full transaction history is stored locally at each client. This
 requires 1+ GB of space, slowly growing.
 .
 This package provides the daemon, salvaged, and the CLI tool
 salvage-cli to interact with the daemon.
